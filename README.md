# Pac-Man-Exercise
This repository contains the Pac Man Exercise from the MIT MERN course.

# Overview

This program allows a user to create between one and 100 pacmen and place them at a random position on a gameboard. When the game is started the pacman move at a random velocity until they hit one of the gameboard's borders.

# Original assignment

* Create a button to allow user to create a Pac Man at a random position and velocity
* Create a button to start all Pac Men moving across the screen
* When a Pac Man hits a border, have it reverse direction 

# Additional modifications

* Added Title
* Added Clear Pac Man button
* Added Stop button
* Added Create Multiple button
* Defined "game board" and allowed for dynamic resizing
* Flipped direction of Pacmen when they hit the edge
* Styled buttons and background

# Buttons

* Start Game -- Causes any pacmen on the gameboard to begin moving. Each pacman moves at a random velocity.
* Stop Game -- Causes any pacmen on the gameboard to stop moving.
* Add PacMan -- Adds a PacMan to the game board at a random position.
* Create Multiple -- Prompts the user for a number between 1 and 100 and creates that number of PacMen on the game board.
* Clear PacMen -- Removes all pacmen from the gameboard.

# Future Improvements

* Allow user to specify size of board
* Add sound effects
* Create a "real" Pac Man game
